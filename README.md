1. When considering a second order cone constraint, a temptation might be to square it in order
to obhain a classical convex quadratic constraint. This might not always work. Consider the
constraint
2Ã—1 + x2 â‰¥ kxk2
,
and its squared conterpart:
(2Ã—1 + x2)
2 â‰¥ kxk
2
2
.
Is the set defined by the first inequality convex? Is the set defined by the second inequality
convex? Draw them both and discuss.
2. We would like to minimize the function f : R
3
7â†’ R, with values:
f(x) = max 
x1 + x2 âˆ’ min(min(x1 + 2, x2 + 2Ã—1 âˆ’ 5), x3 âˆ’ 6),
(x1 âˆ’ x3)
2 + 2x
2
2
1 âˆ’ x1

,
with the constraint kxkâˆž < 1. Explain precisely how to formulate the problem as an SOCP in standard form. Solve using GAMS. 3. The returns on n = 4 assets are described by a Gaussian (normal) random vector r âˆˆ R 4 , having the following expected value rË† and covariance matrix Î£: rË† = ï£® ï£¯ ï£¯ ï£¯ ï£° 0.12 0.10 0.07 0.03 ï£¹ ï£º ï£º ï£º ï£» , Î£ = ï£® ï£¯ ï£¯ ï£¯ ï£° 0.0064 0.0008 âˆ’0.0011 0 0.0008 0.0025 0 0 âˆ’0.0011 0 0.0004 0 0 0 0 0 ï£¹ ï£º ï£º ï£º ï£» . The last (fourth) asset corresponds to a risk-free investment. An investor wants to design a portfolio mix with weights x âˆˆ R 4 (each weight xi is non-negative , and the sum of the weights is one) so as to obtain the best expected return rË† T x, while guaranteeing that (a) no single asset weights more that 40%; (b) the risk-free assests should not weight more that 20%; (c) no asset should weight less than 5%; (d) the probability of experiencing a return lower than q = âˆ’3% should be no larger that  = 10âˆ’4 . What is the maximal achievable expected return, under the above constraints?
